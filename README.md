# Solving-Minimum-Vertex-Cover-for-Graph
The aim of the project is to study how efficient theoretical algorithms for the classical
Vertex Cover problem are in practice. First, we study reduction techniques, exact algorithms and heuristics to find a minimum vertex cover. Then, we implement these algorithms
and study how well they perform on instances that may be useful in practice. Finally, we
make certain observations on the results obtained and conclude with directions for future
works.
